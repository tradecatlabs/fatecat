# Algorithm Coverage

This document is the shipping coverage matrix for the offline GitHub distribution.

It answers one question only:

Can this method be called locally after `horosa-skill install`, without depending on an external Horosa service?

## Shipping Rule

- `Included` means the method is available through the offline runtime and the skill layer.
- `Excluded` means it is intentionally not part of this release.
- This release explicitly excludes `fengshui`.

| Chinese Metaphysics | `fengshui` | n/a | Excluded | Explicitly excluded from this shipping scope. |

## Runtime Layers

- Local Java aggregation layer: `astrostudyboot.jar`
- Local Python calculation layer: `astropy`, `flatlib`, Swiss Ephemeris files, embedded Python deps
- Local Python ken layer: `kinqimen` / `kintaiyi` / `kinjinkou` mounted on the chart service (`/qimen/pan`, `/taiyi/pan`, `/jinkou/pan`)
- Local JS layer: `horosa-core-js` (统摄法 + 数算 canping/heluo engines + ken-response → aiExport.js formatting) executed via bundled Node runtime. The 数算 tools compute four pillars in-process via the vendored bazi chain (`src/vendor/bazi/`), which depends on the bundled `lunar-javascript` npm package (`horosa-core-js/node_modules/lunar-javascript`, shipped in the runtime payload).

## Acceptance Notes

- `qimen`, `taiyi`, `jinkou`, and `sanshiunited` have been verified end-to-end against the ken chart service on macOS (the skill produces the same charts as 星阙, with clean aiExport.js export contracts).
- The macOS and Windows runtime archives are both generated by the release build scripts.
- Windows archive verification is currently structural in this repository environment; native Windows process validation must be done on a Windows machine.
